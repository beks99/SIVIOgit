1,1,Bulawayo,128,40.03,40.23,44.14,39.92,0.599664961,0.400335039,0.40234375,0.59765625,0.441362636,0.558637364,0.399183925,0.600816075,1.842555272,0.460638818,46.06,Bulawayo is the second major city in Zimbabwe and only 46% of MSMEs are fianncially included. 
2,2,Harare,155,61.1,54.52,41.51,38.27,0.389030447,0.610969553,0.54516129,0.45483871,0.415138222,0.584861778,0.382677613,0.617322387,1.732007572,0.433001893,43.3,Harare is the capital city in Zimbabwe and a business hub and yet only 43% of MSMEs are fianncially included which is less than the national average. This is concerning as Harare should be a hub for enterpreneurial activity as it grants access to markets. In Harare 60% of MSMEs face a barrier in the use and access of financial products with over 60% of MSMEs encountering restrictions in the use of their bank and mobile money account. 54% of businesses are compliant and yet Harare scores relatively low in the availability and usage of fiancial products for MSMEs. MSMEs might struggle in Harare as they often have to compete with other more established and formal enterprises as 37% of MSMEs in Harare indicated that their most pressing problem was finding customers.
